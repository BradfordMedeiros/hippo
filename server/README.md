This is the package manager server for automate.
This is a static nginx server that serves up all packages available.

Use cases:
- Install tiles
- Install new modules into automate system
- Other types of themes/sharing for automate

This might be a mistake. 

It might be better to use a standard package manager.
I'd rather keep it simple, and have no concept of dependencies. 

If this ever falls out of a simple wget and scripts off a json, it's too complicated
But something like this makes sense for automate
